The aim of this repository is to collect the code used for the Bayesian Machine Learning project, which was to do a critical analysis of [PAC-Bayesian Theory Meets Bayesian Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636). All our code was based on Pascal Germain's repository https://github.com/pgermain/PAC-Bayesian-Theory-Meets-Bayesian-Inference.

## File execution
The only needed packages are:

numpy

math

matplotlib

Also, the _bayesian_regression.py_ from https://github.com/pgermain/PAC-Bayesian-Theory-Meets-Bayesian-Inference, which is included in this repository, is needed. Moreover, the executed notebook can be found in this repository.

## Disclaimer

The code was not reviewed and it might contain errors, for further information contact us.
