The aim of this repository is to collect the code used for the Bayesian Machine Learning project, which was to do a critical analysis of [PAC-Bayesian Theory Meets Bayesian Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636). All our code was based on Pascal Germain's repository https://github.com/pgermain/PAC-Bayesian-Theory-Meets-Bayesian-Inference.

## File execution
The only needed packages are:

numpy

math

matplotlib

The experiments show that the proposed bound significantly improves the state-of-the-art known
bounds on linear regression when the number of data is small.

* ``bayesian_regression.py`` from https://github.com/pgermain/PAC-Bayesian-Theory-Meets-Bayesian-Inference, which is included in this repository, is needed.
* ``BML_REGUEIRO_SANCHEZDELRIO.ipynb`` is a jupyter notebook requiring the bayesian_regression.py and it produces the illustrative example, which is shown here:
