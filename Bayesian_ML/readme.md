# PAC-Bayesian Theory Meets Bayesian Inference (Bayesian ML project)

Authors: Ramón Daniel REGUEIRO ESPIÑO & María Magdalena SÁNCHEZ DEL RÍO AUFRERE DE LA PREUGNE

The aim of this repository is to collect the code used for the Bayesian Machine Learning project, which was to do a critical analysis of [PAC-Bayesian Theory Meets Bayesian Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636). All our code was based on Pascal Germain's repository https://github.com/pgermain/PAC-Bayesian-Theory-Meets-Bayesian-Inference.
